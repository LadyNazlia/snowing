# snowing in css

This is the most basic way that I could figure our how to make it look like it was snowing. I didn't not write this code,
only modified it to meet the needs of the group project I was working on at the time. 

Base code taken from: [Codeconvey.com](https://codepen.io/codeconvey/pen/xRzQay)
